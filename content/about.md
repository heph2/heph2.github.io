I'm a Computer Science student with a passion for DevOps and system administration. My interests span from automating workflows and managing server infrastructure to exploring the latest trends in cloud computing and containerization. 

With a strong foundation in programming and a keen interest in problem-solving, I enjoy optimizing systems for efficiency, security, and scalability. Iâ€™m continuously learning and experimenting with new tools and technologies to refine my skills in DevOps and sysadmin practices.

In my free time, I dive into projects that deepen my understanding of infrastructure as code, CI/CD pipelines, and cloud platforms. I aim to build solutions that not only perform well but also empower teams to work seamlessly.
