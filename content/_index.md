Welcome to my blog! Here, you’ll find a mix of posts on whatever
sparks my interest; from deploying apps with Nix and exploring the
latest in tech, to sharing my favorite recipes and culinary
experiments.

This space is a creative outlet where I document projects, ideas, and
insights on everything I enjoy. Whether it's a deep dive into DevOps,
a new recipe, or tips on system administration, there’s always
something new to discover.
