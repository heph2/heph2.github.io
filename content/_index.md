Welcome to my blog! Here, you’ll find a mix of posts on whatever sparks my interest—from deploying apps with Nix and exploring the latest in tech, to sharing my favorite recipes and culinary experiments. 

This space is a creative outlet where I document projects, ideas, and insights on everything I enjoy. Whether it's a deep dive into DevOps, a new recipe, or tips on system administration, there’s always something new to discover.

So, grab a cup of coffee, explore, and enjoy the journey with me as I share what I’m passionate about.
